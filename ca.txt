It's raining hard today
It's a bit too much for me
I know it will make you smile
So, let ourselves get wet inside the rain
The whole world is getting filled with your scent
Hope this moment is not a daydream
Calla, someone said that your time
Will be over soon
But Calla, you can always grow back, oh
If you don't have enough sunlight
I'll blow the clouds away, Calla
Bloom yourself until the end
Wherever you are, I'll be there for you
My whole world is filled up
With your scent, babe
I hope this moment's not a daydream
Raindrops shines like the stars
Well, everything shines when I'm with you, babe
Raindrops falls like comets
I'll make this moment not to be a daydream
Calla, someone said that your time
Will be over soon
But Calla, you can always grow back, oh
If you don't have enough sunlight
Calla, someone said that your time
Will be over soon
But Calla, you can always grow back, oh
If you don't have enough sunlight
I'll blow the clouds away, Calla222221

How could my day be bad
When I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Lately, life's so boring
I've been watching Netflix all day long
I thought there would be
No things left to watch
So I let myself out
When I went to the park
I recognised you at a glance
Face to face, we just smiled
We already know that we'll be together (we'll be together)
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Oh, babe
Coffee in the morning, you and the sun
There's a brown hue in your eyes
How pretty it is
I think I'm in love
When I went to the park
I recognised you at a glance
Face to face, we smiled
And I finally held your hands
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Oh, babe
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who gives me love
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Oh, babe
